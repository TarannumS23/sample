    <h3>The Marathi word “Puran” refers to “Sweet stuffing” and “Poli” to “Flatbreads”. Puran Poli are traditional flatbreads from Maharashtra Cuisine,<br/> 
        that are stuffed with sweetened lentils. The outer covering is made with wheat flour or all-purpose flour or sometimes with both.<br/>
        Its rich history and cultural significance have made it a staple of Maharashtrian cuisine, and its unique flavour and texture have captured the hearts of <br/>
        people all over the world. Whether enjoyed on a special occasion or as a simple treat, Puran Poli is a symbol of warmth, hospitality, and tradition.<br/>
